Distinguished technology leader with 19+ years across AIOps, Observability, SaaS Reliability, and Identity & Access Management. Credited with original contributions of major significance adopted by Fortune 500 enterprises and U.S. agencies; automation frameworks reduced MTTR by up to 45% and hardened mission-critical platforms. Performed leading and critical roles in high-impact escalations safeguarding service continuity. Recognized by others in the field as an IEEE Senior Member, IETE Fellow, and SCRS Fellow with peer-reviewed publications, judging roles, and advisory work—evidence of sustained national and international acclaim placing me among the small percentage at the very top of the field. My proposed continued work in the United States will prospectively benefit the United States by scaling identity-aware observability and AI-driven auto-remediation across essential public- and private-sector systems.
